# Eventing RabbitMQ external Cluster Example

## Prerequisites and installation

- Same as listed [here](../../docs/prerequisites.md)
- A working [RabbitMQ Cluster with TLS](https://www.rabbitmq.com/ssl.html)
- The [RabbitMQ Topology Operator to trust the CA](https://www.rabbitmq.com/kubernetes/operator/tls-topology-operator.html)

_NOTE_: We currently don't support the `ssl_options.fail_if_no_peer_cert = true` option in the RabbitmqCluster aditional configuration.

## Steps

### Create a namespace

Create a new namespace for the demo. All the commands are expected to be
executed from the root of this repo.

```sh
kubectl apply -f samples/rabbitmq-mtls/100-namespace.yaml
```
or
```sh
kubectl create ns rabbitmq-mtls-sample
```

### Create a SelfSigned ClusterIssuer and CA certificate using Cert Manager

```sh
kubectl apply -f samples/rabbitmq-mtls/200-selfsigned-issuer-and-cert.yaml
```

We'll need this secrets in the `cert-manager` namespace for the `ClusterIssuer` to work:
```sh
kubectl get secret ca-secret --namespace=rabbitmq-mtls-sample -oyaml | grep -v '^\s*namespace:\s' | kubectl apply --namespace=cert-manager -f -
```

We'll need this secrets in the `rabbitmq-system` namespace too:
```sh
kubectl get secret ca-secret --namespace=rabbitmq-mtls-sample -oyaml | grep -v '^\s*namespace:\s' | kubectl apply --namespace=rabbitmq-system -f -
```

Now let's create the certificate:
```sh
kubectl apply -f samples/rabbitmq-mtls/300-cluster-issuer-and-cert.yaml
```

### Create a RabbitMQ Cluster

Create a RabbitMQ Cluster:

```sh
kubectl apply -f samples/rabbitmq-mtls/400-rabbitmq.yaml
```
or
```
kubectl apply -f - << EOF
apiVersion: rabbitmq.com/v1beta1
kind: RabbitmqCluster
metadata:
  name: rabbitmq
  namespace: rabbitmq-mtls-sample
  annotations:
spec:
  replicas: 1
  tls:
    caSecretName: ca-secret
    secretName: tls-secret
    disableNonTLSListeners: true
  rabbitmq:
    additionalConfig: |
      ssl_options.verify = verify_peer
EOF
```

### Patch the RabbitMQ Topology Operator

For the RabbitMQ Topology Operator to recognize the CA we need to patch it as explained here: [RabbitMQ Topology Operator to trust the CA](https://www.rabbitmq.com/kubernetes/operator/tls-topology-operator.html)

TL;DR:
```sh
kubectl -n rabbitmq-system patch deployment messaging-topology-operator --patch "spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: manager
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /etc/ssl/certs/rabbitmq-ca.crt
          name: rabbitmq-ca
          subPath: ca.crt
      volumes:
      - name: rabbitmq-ca
        secret:
          defaultMode: 420
          secretName: ca-secret"
```

- [Eventing RabbitMQ Source Setup](#eventing-rabbitmq-source-setup)

## Eventing RabbitMQ Broker Setup

### Overview

What this demo shows is how to connect to create a RabbitMQ Broker that uses mTls for the communication with RabbitMQ instances.
It demonstrates how failed events get sent to Dead Letter Sink while successfully processed events do not.

### Components

- [failer](../../cmd/failer/main.go) is a function which takes in a
  CloudEvent and depending on what the specified HTTP response code in the
  message data is will respond with that. So, to simulate a failure, we just
  send it a CloudEvent with a payload of 500, and it's going to simulate a
  failure, by default it will respond with a 200, hence indicating that it
  processed the event successfully, and it should be considered handled.

- [pingsource](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/samples/ping-source/index.html)
  is a Knative source which sends a CloudEvent on pre-defined intervals.

- [event-display](https://github.com/knative/eventing/tree/main/cmd/event_display)
  which is a tool that logs the CloudEvent that it receives formatted nicely.

- [RabbitMQ Broker](../../docs/broker/README.md)

### Configuration

Demo creates two `PingSource`s and has them send an event once a minute. One of
them sends an event that has responsecode set to 200 (event processed
successfully) and one that has responsecode set to 500 (event processing
failed).

Demo creates a `Broker`, using an external RabbitMQ instance, with the delivery configuration that specifies that
failed events will be delivered to `event-display`.

Demo creates a `Trigger` that wires `PingSource` events to go to the `failer`.

### Create the RabbitMQ Broker Config

```sh
kubectl apply -f samples/rabbitmq-mtls/broker-files/100-broker-config.yaml
```
or
```sh
kubectl apply -f - << EOF
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: RabbitmqBrokerConfig
metadata:
  name: default-config
  namespace: rabbitmq-mtls-sample
spec:
  # vhost: you-rabbitmq-vhost
  rabbitmqClusterReference:
    namespace: rabbitmq-mtls-sample
    name: rabbitmq-secret-credentials
  queueType: quorum
EOF
```

### Create the RabbitMQ Broker

```sh
kubectl apply -f samples/rabbitmq-mtls/broker-files/200-broker.yaml
```
or
```sh
kubectl apply -f - << EOF
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
kind: Broker
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: rabbitmq-mtls-sample
  annotations:
    eventing.knative.dev/broker.class: RabbitMQBroker
spec:
  config:
    apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1alpha1
    kind: RabbitmqBrokerConfig
    name: default-config
  delivery:
    deadLetterSink:
      ref:
        apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
        kind: Service
        name: event-display
        namespace: rabbitmq-mtls-sample
    retry: 5
EOF
```

### Create the Dead Letter Sink

Then create the Knative Serving Service which will receive any failed events.

```sh
kubectl apply -f samples/rabbitmq-mtls/500-sink.yaml
```
or
```sh
kubectl apply -f - << EOF
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: event-display
  namespace: rabbitmq-mtls-sample
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: gcr.io/knative-releases/knative.dev/eventing/cmd/event_display
EOF
```

Now the Broker will become ready, might take a few seconds to get the Service up
and running.

```sh
kubectl -n rabbitmq-mtls-sample get brokers
NAME      URL                                                                   AGE     READY   REASON
default   http://default-broker-ingress.rabbitmq-mtls-sample.svc.cluster.local   2m39s   True
```

### Create the Ping Sources

```sh
kubectl apply -f samples/rabbitmq-mtls/broker-files/300-ping-sources.yaml
```
or
```sh
kubectl apply -f - << EOF
apiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1
kind: PingSource
metadata:
  name: ping-source
  namespace: rabbitmq-mtls-sample
spec:
  schedule: "*/1 * * * *"
  data: '{"responsecode": 200}'
  sink:
    ref:
      apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Broker
      name: default
      namespace: rabbitmq-mtls-sample
EOF
```

```sh
kubectl apply -f - << EOF
apiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1
kind: PingSource
metadata:
  name: ping-source-2
  namespace: rabbitmq-mtls-sample
spec:
  schedule: "*/1 * * * *"
  data: '{"responsecode": 500}'
  sink:
    ref:
      apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Broker
      name: default
      namespace: rabbitmq-mtls-sample
EOF
```

### Create Trigger

```sh
kubectl apply -f samples/rabbitmq-mtls/broker-files/400-trigger.yaml
```
or
```sh
kubectl apply -f - << EOF
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
kind: Trigger
metadata:
  name: failer-trigger
  namespace: rabbitmq-mtls-sample
  annotations:
    # Value must be between 1 and 1000
    # A value of 1 RabbitMQ Trigger behaves as a FIFO queue
    # Values above 1 break message ordering guarantees and can be seen as more performance oriented.
    # rabbitmq.eventing.knative.dev/parallelism: "10"
spec:
  broker: default
  filter:
    attributes:
      type: dev.knative.sources.ping
  subscriber:
    ref:
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Service
      name: failer
      namespace: rabbitmq-mtls-sample
EOF
```

### Create Failer

```sh
kubectl apply -f samples/rabbitmq-mtls/broker-files/500-failer.yaml
```
or
```sh
kubectl apply -f 'https://storage.googleapis.com/knative-nightly/eventing-rabbitmq/latest/failer.yaml' -n rabbitmq-mtls-sample
```

### Check the results

Look at the failer pod logs, you see it's receiving both 200/500 responses.

```sh
kubectl -n rabbitmq-mtls-sample -l='serving.knative.dev/service=failer' logs -c user-container
2020/10/06 10:35:00 using response code: 200
2020/10/06 10:35:00 using response code: 500
2020/10/06 10:35:00 using response code: 500
2020/10/06 10:35:00 using response code: 500
2020/10/06 10:35:01 using response code: 500
2020/10/06 10:35:01 using response code: 500
2020/10/06 10:35:03 using response code: 500
```

You see there are both 200 / 500 events there. And more importantly, you can see
that 200 is only sent once to the failer since it's processed correctly.
However, the 500 is sent a total of 6 times because we have specified the retry
of 5 (original, plus 5 retries for a total of 6 log entries).

However, the event-display (the Dead Letter Sink) only sees the failed events
with the response code set to 500.

```sh
kubectl -n rabbitmq-mtls-sample -l='serving.knative.dev/service=event-display' logs -c user-container

## Eventing RabbitMQ Source Setup

### Overview

This demo will use a RabbitMQ Source to fetch messages from a RabbitMQ Exchange, convert them into [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io/) and send them to a [Sink](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/sinks/#about-sinks). The complete list of the Source's config parameters are shown [here](../../docs/source/README.md)

### Components

- [perf-test](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-perf-test) RabbitMQ has a throughput testing tool, PerfTest, that is based on the Java client and can be configured to simulate basic to advanced workloads of messages sent to a RabbitMQ Cluster. More info about the perf-test testing tool can be found [here](../perf-test.help.env.text)

- [event-display](https://github.com/knative/eventing/tree/main/cmd/event_display)
  which is a tool that logs the CloudEvent that it receives formatted nicely.

- [RabbitMQ Source](../../docs/source/README.md)

### Configuration

Demo creates a `PerfTest` and has it executes a loop where it sends 1 event per second for 30 seconds, and then no events for 30 seconds to the `RabbitMQ Cluster Exchange` called `eventing-rabbitmq-source` predeclared by the user.

Demo creates a `Source` to read messages from the `eventing-rabbitmq-source` `Exchange` and to send them to the `event-display` `sink` after the translation to CloudEvents.

### Create the Perf Test Service

This will create a Kubernetes Deployment which sends events to the RabbitMQ Cluster Exchange

```sh
kubectl apply -f samples/rabbitmq-mtls/source-files/100-perf-test.yaml
```

Messages from the `rabbitmq-perf-test`

### Create the RabbitMQ Source's Sink

Then create the Knative Serving Service which will receive translated events.

```sh
kubectl apply -f samples/rabbitmq-mtls/500-sink.yaml
```
or
```sh
kubectl apply -f - << EOF
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: event-display
  namespace: rabbitmq-mtls-sample
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: gcr.io/knative-releases/knative.dev/eventing/cmd/event_display
EOF
```

### Create the RabbitMQ Source

```sh
kubectl apply -f samples/rabbitmq-mtls/source-files/200-source.yaml
```
or
```sh
kubectl apply -f - << EOF
apiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: RabbitmqSource
metadata:
  name: rabbitmq-source
  namespace: rabbitmq-mtls-sample
spec:
  rabbitmqClusterReference:
    namespace: rabbitmq-mtls-sample
    name: rabbitmq
  rabbitmqResourcesConfig:
    # vhost: you-rabbitmq-vhost
    exchangeName: "eventing-rabbitmq-source"
    queueName: "eventing-rabbitmq-source"
  sink:
    ref:
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Service
      name: event-display
      namespace: rabbitmq-mtls-sample
EOF
```

### Check the results

Check the event-display (the Dead Letter Sink) to see if it is receiving events.
It may take a while for the Source to start sending events to the Sink, so be patient :p!

```sh
kubectl -n rabbitmq-mtls-sample -l='serving.knative.dev/service=event-display' logs -c user-container
